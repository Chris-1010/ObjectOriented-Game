

For my assignment, I created a object-oriented restaurant game which effectively challenges the user in the aspects of both memory and spelling.

This game includes a Restaurant class, Order class, Food class, and a class for each type of food (Pizza, Burger, etc.)

Throughout the project, the following concepts are used:

    Concept                 Example of Use
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Getter/Setter   -     This is used in the Order class, used to get and set new customer orders.
    Property           -     This is used in the Order class, where the getOrder and setOrder methods are encapsulated into a property, further encapsulating the variables also.
    Encapsulatiion -    This is used in the Food class, where the variables are private and can only be accessed through the getters and setters.
    Inheritance      -     This is used in the Food subclasses (Pizza, Burger, Burrito, Hotdog), where they inherit the variables and methods from the Food superclass.
    Aggregation     -     This is used in the Order class, where its food attribute has a Food object.
    Try/Except       -     This is used in the Restaurant class, where there is an attempt to convert the user's cooking time input to an integer.
